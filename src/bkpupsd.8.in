.Sh NAME
.Nm bkpupsd
.Nd Simple UPS daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dhnpv
.Op Fl r Ar number
.Op Fl s Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar seconds
.Op ups-type[:device]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a Simple Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) daemon to control
BK Pro series and BK series by American Power Conversion Corp, 
FREQUPS A/F series by Mitsubishi Electric Corp.  And now, it should
support UPS which detect its status and control it through serial
port's modem control bits;
DTR(Data Terminal Ready), RTS(Request To send), CTS(Clear To Send),
CAR(CArrier Detect), RNG(Ring), DSR(Data Set Ready).
The
.Nm
utility is designed to control UPS in dumb mode and
never reads or writes any data on serial port but only checks modem
bits' status.
.Pp
For BK PRO and BK series, dual purpose cable 940-0095A or
dumb mode cable 940-0020B are tested to work.  Dual purpose cable
940-0095B are tested to work with some caution, see
.B BUGS
section.
.Pp
For FREQUPS F series,
the bundled cable is tested to work and dip switch #2 of FREQUPS
must be set to on and dip switch #4 should be set to on.
.Pp
For FREQUPS A series, dip switch #4 should be set to on and other dip
switches should be off (default).
.Pp
Other type cables aren't tested at all.
Current specifications cable are follows:
.Bl -tag -width -flag
.It UPS
When the line power goes out, the UPS switches power source to battery
and notify it through changing the serial port's signal.
.Pp
After line power goes out and if battery remaining becomes lower,
the UPS notifies it through changing the serial port's signal.
.Pp
The UPS induces itself to shutdown mode when it gets some serial port's
signal.
.Pp
.It bkpupsd
.Nm
starts with ups name specified in the
.Xr upstab 5
file on startup, and read parameter for corresponding ups.
Then
.Nm
opens the serial port specified with command line option, and sets its
status if needed.
.Pp
.Nm
checks the serial port, changing of modem control bits  periodcally.
If it matches line power failure condition,
.Nm
runs the
.Pa line.lost
(power fail warning script) and reports the line power failure via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
If timeout is specified by
.Fl t
option, and the line power failure continued more than this
timeout value,
.Nm
runs the
.Pa line.shutdown
(shutdown script), reports via
.Xr syslog 3 ,
makes the UPS to sleep by setting corresponding modem control bits,
and finally shutdowns the machine.
.Pp
While the UPS supplies power from the battery, and its remaining
lower has detected,
.Nm
runs the
.Pa battery.shutdown
(emergency shutdown script) immediately, reports via
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and makes the UPS to sleep.
.Pp
If the line power recovers before the timeout or low battery condition,
.Nm
runs the
.Pa line.recover
(script for power recovery) and continues to monitor the
serial port.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d
Debug mode, don't detach terminal nor do
.Xr fork 2 .
.It Fl h
Show simple help message and exit.
.It Fl n
Test mode.  With this option,
.Nm
dosen't execute external scripts at all nor don't sleep UPS.
.It Fl p
Specify that don't make UPS into sleep mode.
(This option was experimental option past.)
.It Fl r
Specify the line recovery time in seconds by followed number.
.It Fl s
Specify local syslog facility by followed number; if you specify
1, then syslog uses LOG_LOCAL1 facility.  Without
.Fl s
option, LOG_DAEMON facility will be used.
.It Fl t
This option specifies the time in seconds by followed number.
When line power has gone, UPS continues to supply power from the
battery.  If line power dosen't recover within this seconds,
.Nm
will shutdown the machine by the external script.
.It Fl v
Show version and exit.
.It ups-type[:device]
specifies ups type and you can specify the device file for serial port
to which it is attached.  Default device is
.Pa /dev/dty00
in NetBSD,
.Pa /dev/cuaa0
in FreeBSD.

.Sh NOTES
The interface cable must be compatible with manufacturer's interface kits.
.Pp
The scripts can be modified ajusting your system.
The recommanded file permissions for these scripts are "chmod
root.wheel 700"(because anyone who can run these scripts also get
the privilage of shutdonw the system). bkpupsd requires to be run
in root privilage to execute the shell-scripts.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr upstab 5 ,
.Sh BUGS
Command line options aren't backward compatible with previous version
of
.Nm bkpupsd .
.Pp
If the power recover after the shutdown script run, the system
shutdown will not be canceled, auto-restart may not performed and
the system may be shutdowned until restart is invoked using reset
switch.
.Pp
Program's name,
.Nm
is somewhat historical.
