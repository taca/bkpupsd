.Sh NAME
.Nm upstab
.Nd UPS capability data base
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a data base describing UPS used for
.Xr bkpupsd 8 .
.Nm
based on 
.Xr termcap 5
style format, consist of a number of `:'-separated fields.
The first entry for each UPS gives the names that are known for the
UPS, separated by `|' characters.
The first name given is the most common abbreviation for the UPS.
The last name given should be a long name fully identifying the UPS,
and all others are understood as synonyms for the UPS name.
All names but the last should be in lower case and contain no blanks;
the last name may well contain upper case characters and blanks for
readability.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
The characters in the
.Em Notes
field in the table have the following meanings and
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
s	indicated status is set by program
r	indicated status is read from UPS
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -column indent indent indent
.Sy Name	Type	Note	Description
.It "init	str	s	Initilize UPS."
.It "status	str	r	UPS ready status."
.It "line	str	r	line lost status."
.It "low	str	r	battery low status."
.It "sleep	str	s	make UPS in sleep mode."
.It "noaction	bool		Don't set status for UPS."
.It "timeout	bool		Use timeout, don't wait for battery low."
.It "kernel	bool		Use kernel supported serial port control when shutdown."
.El
.Pp
Each string type capabilities represent which modem bits check or set.
modem bit strings are separated by comma, it is set or reset by its
order when setting serial port.
.Pp
Each modem bit string are preceeded by plus (+) or minus (-) character.
`+' means the bit will be set or check the bit has set, `-' means
the bit will be reset or check the bit hasn't set.
.Pp
Supported modem bits are represented as following strings.
.Pp
.Bl -column indent indent indent
.Sy Name	Note	Description
.It "CTS		Clear To Send"
.It "DSR		Data Set Ready"
.It "DTR		Data Terminal Ready"
.It "LE	r	Line Enable"
.It "RNG		Ring"
.It "RTS		Request To Send"
.It "SR	r	Secondary Receive"
.It "ST	r	Secondary Transmit"
.El
.Pp
If
.Em Notes
field in the table has `r', the bit should be used for showing status by
.Xr bkpupsd 8
only, and shouldn't be used for
.Nm upstab .
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLE
A simple example is here:
.Bd -literal
bkpro\||\|BK Pro with 940-0095A:\e
	:init=-RTS,+DTR:status=-RTS,-DTR,+DTR:line=+RNG:low=+CAR:\e
	:sleep=-DTR,+DTR,-RTS:
.Ed
.Pp
In this case, reset DTR then set DTR on startup.  Reset RTS, DTR
then set DTR before get serial port status.  And check the status;
line power lost if RNG is set, battery is low if CAR is set.
Reset DTR, set DTR then reset RTS sequence make UPS in sleep mode.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
freqf\||\|FreqUPS F seriese:\e
	:init=-DTR,-RTS,+RTS:startup=+CTS,+CAR:line=-CTS:low=-CAR:\e
	:sleep=+DTR:
.Ed
.Pp
In this case, after setting serial port on startup, then wait for
CTS and CAR are set.

.Sh BUGS
Not all of modem bits could be really set to UPS from
.Xr bkpupsd 8 .

The

appeared after FreeBSD 2.2.8, and should works on NetBSD 1.4 and later.
